      <p>
        We all need help at some point in our lives. So it stands to reason that
        the people in our lives need help sometimes, too.<br />
        Most of us are happy to help the people we love. In fact, plenty of
        people would happily help a stranger in need.

          We often depend on our classmates and coworkers. We may end up<br />
          needing to work closely with them on certain projects. <br />You can
          form a tight bond with someone when you work together or are in a
          competitive school department.
